# SQL Project

This repository contains my solutions to a series of SQL practice questions using the AdventureWorks database.

it was given to me as part of a Data Analyst course and is designed to help you strengthen your SQL skill. 

AdventureWorks is a sample database from Microsoft that is commonly used for learning and demonstrations in SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.


## Requirements
- Access to a SQL Server instance or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) where you can connect to and query the AdventureWorks database.
- If you haven't already, download the AdventureWorks database from Microsoft [Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms).
- notice I used the 2022 AdventureWorks database
## How to Use
- after downloading the file, open it using SSMS or your preferred SQL query tool.
- make sure you are using the AdventureWorks database.
- mark down each query and run it individually.
- notice there is a view I created at the top that is being used in some of the queries. so run this first.
