# SQL Project

This repository contains my solutions to a series of SQL practice questions using the AdventureWorks database.

it was given to me as part of a Data Analyst course and is designed to help you strengthen your SQL skill. 

AdventureWorks is a sample database from Microsoft that is commonly used for learning and demonstrations in SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.


## Requirements
- Access to a SQL Server instance or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) where you can connect to and query the AdventureWorks database.
- If you haven't already, download the AdventureWorks database from Microsoft [Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms).
- notice I used the 2022 AdventureWorks database
## How to Use
- after downloading the file, open it using SSMS or your preferred SQL query tool.
- make sure you are using the AdventureWorks database.
- mark down each query and run it individually.
- notice there is a view I created at the top that is being used in some of the queries. so run this first.

## Additional Information
- you can learn more about AdventureWorks database [here](https://dataedo.com/samples/html/AdventureWorks/doc/AdventureWorks_2/home.html)
- for exemple you can learn from this that in Q2 the reason its all 'Unknown' is because all of those customers are stores and they have no first and last name and they are placing orders via a sales person.
